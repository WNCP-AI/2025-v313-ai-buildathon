## TypeScript & Next.js Rules

- Use `strict` types; avoid `any`. Export function signatures with explicit types.
- Prefer async/await with early returns; avoid deep nesting.
- Client components must start with `'use client'` and avoid Node APIs.
- Use segment-based routing under `app/*` with `page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`.
- Server-only code belongs in Server Components, Route Handlers, or `app/api/*`.
- Imports: prefer `@/` absolute alias (see `tsconfig.json`).
- Do not swallow errors; log or bubble with context.
- Keep files focused; extract helpers to `lib/*`.
