## Data Models

- Align UI enums with SQL enums in [`supabase/schema.sql`](mdc:supabase/schema.sql):
  - `service_category`: `food_delivery | courier | aerial_imaging | site_mapping`
  - `provider_type`: `courier | drone`
  - `booking_status`: `pending | accepted | in_progress | completed | cancelled`
- Types come from [`types/database.ts`](mdc:types/database.ts); import rather than re-declare
- Price fields are DECIMAL in DB; convert to numbers in UI with care
- Use `updated_at` ordering where available; triggers maintain timestamps
